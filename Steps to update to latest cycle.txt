Steps to update to latest cycle

$previousCycle = 1506
$latestCycle = 1507

mkdir "dtpp-${latestCycle}"

#unzip all of the dtpp archives to one directory
	unzip -q -u "DDTPP?_20$latestCycle.zip" -d dtpp-$latestCycle

#1
#Create the new cycle database named dtpp-$latestCycle.db and download IAP,APD charts
  ./load_dtpp_metadata.pl . $latestCycle
  
#2  
#Copy the old georeference database data to the new cycle db (overwriting auto data) along with hashes of GCPs
  ./moveOldCycleDataToNewCycle.pl $previousCycle $latestCycle

#2a
#remove empty stored hash files
#	find ./dtpp-$latestCycle -type f -name '*AD-hash*' -size -30c -exec rm '{}' ';'

#3  
#Run autogeoref for added/changed plates and update their statistics
  ./georeferencePlatesViaDb.pl -n -s $latestCycle

#4
#Manually verify everything
  ./verifyGeoreference.pl $latestCycle

#4
#Remove unecessary info (unused columns, bad statuses etc)

#To see count of statuses:
#	select 
#		status, count(status) 
#	from 
#		dtppgeo 
#	group by
#		 status;
